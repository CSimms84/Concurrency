# ThreadLifecycles

This project demonstrates the different states of a thread in Java. The Java thread lifecycle includes the following states: `New`, `Runnable`, `Blocked`, `Waiting`, `Timed Waiting`, and `Terminated`. This folder contains Java files that illustrate each of these states.

## Files

1. **BlockedThread.java**
   - Demonstrates a thread entering the `Blocked` state.
   - Contains a synchronized method to ensure that one thread blocks another.

2. **Main.java**
   - The entry point for running the demonstrations.
   - Executes each of the thread lifecycle examples.

3. **NewThread.java**
   - Demonstrates a thread in the `New` state.
   - The thread is created but not yet started.

4. **RunnableThread.java**
   - Demonstrates a thread in the `Runnable` state.
   - The thread is started and ready to run or is currently running.

5. **TerminatedThread.java**
   - Demonstrates a thread in the `Terminated` state.
   - The thread has completed its execution.

6. **TimedWaitingThread.java**
   - Demonstrates a thread in the `Timed Waiting` state.
   - The thread is waiting for a specified amount of time.

7. **WaitingThread.java**
   - Demonstrates a thread in the `Waiting` state.
   - The thread is waiting indefinitely until another thread performs a particular action.

## Thread States in Java

1. **New**
   - A thread that has been created but not yet started.

2. **Runnable**
   - A thread that is ready to run or currently running.

3. **Blocked**
   - A thread that is blocked, waiting for a monitor lock.

4. **Waiting**
   - A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.

5. **Timed Waiting**
   - A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time.

6. **Terminated**
   - A thread that has exited.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java 21 installed.
2. Compile the Java files:
    ```sh
    javac *.java
    ```
3. Run the `Main` class:
    ```sh
    java Main
    ```
